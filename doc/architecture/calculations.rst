Precision of internal calculations
==================================

MW4 is using for all calculations the skyfield (https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/)
from Brandon Rhodes. As for the new command set offered with 10microns FW3.x it
needs to calculate the alt/az coordinates for a satellite track each second for
the entire track. As you would like to follow the as precise as possible I made
some comparisons between the internal calculations done in 10micron mount and the
results provided by skyfield.

In skyfield there is a chapter about satellite calculations and precision:
https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/earth-satellites.html#avoid-calling-the-observe-method
Despite the fact that the observe method is expensive the difference in calulation
time for a 900 step track is on my computer 120ms (using more precise observe
method) to 7ms (using the less precise difference).

Brandon writes about it:

.. epigraph::

    While satellite positions are only accurate to about a kilometer anyway,
    accounting for light travel time only affected the position in this case by
    less than an additional tenth of a kilometer. This difference is not
    meaningful when compared to the uncertainty that is inherent in satellite
    positions to begin with, so you should neglect it and simply subtract
    GCRS-centered vectors instead as detailed above.

Here the charts for NOAA 15 [B] at julian date JD=2459333.26498 for the transit
happening. The used TLE data was:

.. code-block:: python

You could see the alt/az of the sat track.

There is a set of plots for another satellite, which shows the same behavior. The
used TLE data was:

You could see the alt/az of the sat track.

For all calculations is valid:

- they are using refraction correction with the same values.

- the coordinates from 10micron are gathered with :TLEGEQJD#, :TLEGAZJD# commands

- julian date is in UTC time system

- 10micron firmware 3.0.4

- skyfield version 1.39
