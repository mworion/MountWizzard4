Architectural topics and math
=============================
Within these pages I would explain how and why I made the architecture decisions
for linking it with the 10micron mount computer. This might help for setting up or
just explain the behavior you experience when using MW4. I do this also as my
development documentation. There might be some faults and error in it. If you find
one, please let me know. I would like to get MW4 from it's technical base as clean
as possible.
