Architectural topics and math
=============================
Within these pages I would explain how and why I made the architecture decisions
for linking it with the 10micron mount computer. This might help for setting up or
just explain the behavior you experience when using MountWizzard4. I do this also 
as my development documentation. There might be some faults and error in it. If 
you find one, please let me know. I would like to get MountWizzard4 from it's 
technical base as clean as possible.
