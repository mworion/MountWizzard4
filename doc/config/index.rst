Configuration
=============
The configuration part of the documentation is divided into several sections,
each of which describes a different aspect of the configuration of the
observatory setup. There were several aspects of tuning MountWizzard4 to your
needs, and this section will help you to understand how to do that. Still there
is many more information in tooltips and help texts in the application itself.
