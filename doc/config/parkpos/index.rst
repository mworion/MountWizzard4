Configuring themes
==================
MountWizzard4 supports now 3 different color sets. These could be selected in
settings:

and will be persisted after closing the application. They could be changed
during runtime.

Getting a nor dim color set for those, who use the application in the field.

    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Light day theme
---------------
For those ones who sit more inside and like lighter themes as well, but need not
to take care about brighter coloring.
