Terrain image & horizon mask
============================
For an optimal use of model points, slew path etc. it is necessary to define a
horizon mask for the use in MW4. There are several way to define and use a mask
based on your actual environment

Using terrain image from streetview app
---------------------------------------
Please use streeview app to generate a 360 degrees image around your mount rig.

.. image:: image/streetviewapp.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 33%

If you finished the image and transferred it to you computer it might look like:

.. image:: image/terrain.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Please put this image to you config dir in your MW4 working folder. The file
format output from streetview is 4096 X 2048 pixel color as JPG. The horizon for
altitude 0 degree cuts the image in an upper and lower half. MW4 uses only the
upper half of the image as it expects the image to be taken at the height of the
horizon line.

.. note:: The image file has to be named to: **terrain.jpg** and should be in JPG
          format.

MW4 will use the image as greyscale image. You could play around how you prepare
the image before you copy it to the config directory. Good ideas of improving the
image are: make the sky transparent, equalize gamma / lightness settings to avoid
highlights in the image, etc. Once you open the hemisphere window you see the
setups for the terrain background.

.. image:: image/terrain_setup.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

After **use terrain** is checked and a terrain.jpg image is available in config
directory, the image will be shown as background of hemisphere.

.. image:: image/terrain_hemisphere.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

The image will also show up in polar diagram!

.. image:: image/terrain_hemisphere_polar.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Two adjustments could be changed to make the image fit for use: Most important
the azimuth adjustment.

* You shift the image by a number of degrees (0 - 359) to get your image fit to
  the cardinal points of the hemisphere.
* You could change the alpha channel of the image to get a nice view on your
  screen.

Then you could add the horizon mask quite easily:

.. image:: image/terrain_hemisphere_mask.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

.. note:: The horizon line (altitude = 0) is set within streetview. Please try
          to shoot the image at the height of your mount to make it fit. Still
          there might be some deviations from "real life".

.. warning:: All calculations which respect a horizon mask reference to a given
             mask not the image itself. So even if you have an image set, you
             need to define horizon mask points!
