Feature Overview
================

For being fully operational, MW4 needs either:

-   INDI server(s) (see: https://indilib.org) where your devices are connected to.

-   INDIGO server(s) (see: http://www.indigo-astronomy.org) where your devices
    are connected to.

-   ASCOM Alpaca remote server (see: https://ascom-standards.org/FAQs/Index.htm)
    abstracting your ASCOM devices or devices which speak native ASCOM Alpaca if
    you want to connect over IP with your environment.

-   Running versions of Sequence Generator Pro or N.I.N.A. as frontend for camera
    device.

-   For the core devices there is native ASCOM support (Windows platform only).
    Please be reminded, that ASCOM has 32bit and 64bit driver implementations
    and MW4 could also be installed in 32bit or 64 bit python environment. They
    could be not be mixed! 32bit python supports only 32bit drivers and vice versa
    . Normally this should not be an issue...

-   In addition an internet connection is used for some services which might be
    very helpful.

It is recommended to use mount firmware 3.x or later as some of the functions
don't work with older firmware versions. It should not be a problem using older
versions. A HW pre2012 might also have some issues. MW4 supports also older
firmwares from 2.x onwards, but with limited features and untested.

It is recommended to use mount firmware 2.16 or later as some of the functions
don't work with older firmware versions.

Here is an overview of the functionality available in MW4:

- Many settings and features of the mount can be shown and changed.
- Control movement of the mount as well as tracking speeds.
- Coordinates in J2000 as well as in JNow.
- Virtual keypad
- Model building with different model setups and model generating capabilities.
  Sorting points for effective slew paths or dome situations.
- Model building is done in parallel threads (imaging, plate solving, slewing)
  to reduce time.
- Show the actual model and alignment error. Give hints on how to improve the
  raw polar alignment.
- Model optimisation: deleting points, automatic removing point for target RMS etc.
- Manage models stored in the mount (save, load, delete).
- Dome geometry integration (MW4 knows about target flip side and slews dome
  correctly as well as any geometrical constraints).
- Environment data: MW4 shows data from OpenWeatherMap, ClearOutside, External
  Sensors like MBox, Stickstation, UniHedronSQR as well as direct linked sensors
  like MGBox.
- Refraction handling external / internal from the above sources.
- Satellite: searching, displaying, programming, updating tracking.
- Tools: FITS Header renaming, Park positions, etc.
- Remote shutdown of MW4 and Mount via IP commands.
- Measurements and CSV saving for most environment and mount data
- Imaging: control of connected camera / cooler / filter.
- WOL (wake on LAN) boot for mount. MW4 catches MAC address automatically on
  first manual start.
- Audio signals for different events (end slew, finished modeling, alert, etc.)
- Updater for all MW4 functions.
- Generate / load / save as many profiles as you would like.
- Show alignment stars. Choose and automatically center for polar or orthogonal
  adjustments.
- Imaging: expose one or N images, auto solve or auto stack these images.
- Imaging: show distortion grid, astrometric calculations (flux, roundness,
  sharpness)
