Install on Astroberry RaspberryPi
=================================

I strongly recommend using the actual astroberry server https://www.astroberry.io
if you would like to use KSTars/EKOS and MountWizzard4 on a Raspi (3 or 4).

Under https://github.com/mworion/MountWizzard4/tree/master/support you will find
the necessary scripts to install MW4 directly under astroberry. Please download
the corresponding ZIP archive (Astroberry_Scripts.zip), make a working directory
on astroberry server, extract the archive there and run the install script.

For starting MW4, please start the run script. Basically that's all to do.

.. hint:: Actually astroberry is supported from MW4 version 2.1.3 on. It has some
          limitations in features: no support of 3D mount simulator.

.. warning:: The installation for is dedicated for a 32bit system on Raspi4. If
             you plan to use a 64 bis system, please look to StellarMate64
