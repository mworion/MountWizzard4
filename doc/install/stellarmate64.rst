Install on StellarMate1.7++ (64bit)
===================================
Another way of using MW4 on Raspi4 64 Bit is to download bullseye 64bit image or
an Stellarmate1.7++ image. On the support page you will find the corresponding
install and run script as ZIP archive. Please download them in your work folder.
The scripts will use precompiled wheels for aarch64 as much as possible to improved
the installation speed e.g. on your RPi4.

.. code-block:: python

    ./MW4_Install.sh

After a short while MW4 is installed and should be ready to run like in ubuntu
installation.

.. note:: The install scripts only support python 3.8-3.9 versions"
