Using the internal updater
==========================
From version 2 on MW4 brings an improved updater concept. Basically you choose
to update within MW4 ans select the version of choice. After that a check if
version exists will be processed and if successful, MW4 will be closed and the
updater program will be started.

.. note:: MW4 does not store your actual settings. If you would like to do so,
          please **save** your configuration before updating.

Once the updater program has started you see which version will be installed. Now
you could start the update or just cancel it.

If started, the updater will download and install all necessary libraries.

The updater finishes automatically and reloads MW4. This will happen in both cases
**Cancel Update** and **Start Update**. If you close the updater
window
directly, MW4 will be not reloaded.
