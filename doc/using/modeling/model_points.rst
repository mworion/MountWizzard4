Selecting model points
======================

The first step for building a model is the selection of the desired model points.
Handling you horizon is an important step as MW4 helps you could in finding
points, which were not covered through obstacles in your location defined by the
horizon line.

There were multiple ways of setting your model points within MW4:

.. hlist::
    :columns: 1

    * From file
    * In a generated alt/az grid
    * First align points on defined alt
    * Points along the celestial slew paths
    * Equally distributed over the sphere (golden spiral)
    * Based on a DSO track of an object with define Ra/Dec
    * Manually set point (in hemisphere window)

There are multiple parameters or selections available to refine your point
selection. the best way to find out is simplest to test them.

.. note::   Please think that you distribute the model points at the end over a
            sphere! Using alt/az is convenient, but might be misleading. You could
            enable the polar view in hemisphere window to get an image how the
            points are spread in a polar diagram.

It makes a lot of sense if you have discovered you favourite model points setup to
store them in a file and reload them whenever you want. You could store as many
files as you want.

MW4 does a default sorting for you. If the default does not fit to your setup,
you could tweak the order and additional constraints like you want. These settings
ae store persistent in your profile.

.. hlist::
    :columns: 1

    * Auto sort point -> default
    * East / West: points from East coordinate to west coordinate (az)
    * High / Low: point from high altitude to low altitude (good for domes)
    * Avoid meridian flip: modeling start at the actual pier side
    * Auto delete point below horizon
    * Add safety distance: adds selected degrees safety margin to horizon
    * Auto delete within meridian limits

.. warning::    Regardless what you select, the 10micron mount computer could only
                handle a maximum of 100 points

In addition you could also mix different types of model point generation by
checking

.. epigraph::   **keep points from existing generation**

MW4 will not cleanup the point map before adding new point, but add them.
