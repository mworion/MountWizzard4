Welcome to MountWizzard4!
=========================
MW4 is a utility for 10micron users for improving the workflow for astronomy work
and imaging runs on Windows10 (Win7 should be fine, but it will be not tested),
Mac OSX (beginning from 10.12 to 11.x) and Linux (Ubuntu from 16.04 to 20.04). If
you have some knowledge around Raspberry Piâ€™s and other SOC, you might be able to
install MW4 on a RPi3+, RPi4. Basically is it an automation and support tool, most
of the core functions are provided by the mount computer.
