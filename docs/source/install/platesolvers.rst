Installing Platesolvers
=======================

When starting with the use of MW4, you might need to install a plate solver.
Actually MW4 supports only local plate solvers like ASTAP, Cloudmakers (on OSx)
and astrometry.net.

ASTAP could be downloaded from https://www.hnsky.org/astap.htm, please follow their
instructions. ASTAP is available for all platforms (Mac, Ubuntu and Windows)

Astrometry.net local install is available on Ubuntu you could install it with

.. code-block:: python

    sudo apt-get install astrometry.net

Pleas keep in mind that for both programs you need to install the index files as
well.
