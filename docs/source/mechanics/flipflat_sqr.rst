1. Step: attaching the unihedron to the holder
----------------------------------------------
Please remove to original 4 screws, which close the package of the device from the button.
Put the device upside down below the holder part and use the 4 self cutting screws to fix
the unihedron to the holder.

3. Step: attach the two drew shield rings
-----------------------------------------
The OTA ring with the nose should be on the upper side of the OTA the second on
the lower side. Use two M4 screws to tighten the connection. As I used PETG, I
did not need a thread nut. please check this in your case.
The OTA ring should be directly linked to the drew shield end.

4. Step: attach the holder to the dew shield ring nose
------------------------------------------------------
The holder slips exactly on the nose of the dew shield rings.
