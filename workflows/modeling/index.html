<h1>Modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>I only focus on model building with tool support, so no words about manual model
building. I don’t know the internal algorithms of the 10micron mount how the
calculate their corrections. So many of the hints derive from pure logical or
mathematical approaches and even there I personally might have some
misconceptions or make some errors.</p>
<p>So my goal in model building is quite simple: I’m lazy in doing setups, so I
want a solutions which gives me a correction model most accurate in minimum of
time automatically. I rely heavily on the corrections capability on the 10micron
mounts, so I use them always with dual tracking on. For doing a setup there are
many things to think of beside the model (leveling, rigidity etc.). Keep them
perfect, but I don’t talk about them. So this results in two tasks I have to do
to get a model to do unguided images: Polar alignment and the model for
correction itself. I refer to the Blog Filippo Riccio from 10micron:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.10micron.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=846">https://www.10micron.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=846</a></p>
<p>All the hints you get from the mount (how to turn knobs, alignment star) improve
the alignment. As the model is only an approximation for the error correction,
it will be not an one step approach. If you aim for the best result, please
think of 2-3 iterations of the whole procedure. In my setup I normally need 2
iterations for doing an alignment which is good for 20-30 min exposures and have
round stars.</p>
<p>As Overview: MountWizzard4 has a straight forward approach for building models.
The following chart shows each basic step.</p>
<a class="drawio reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/workflow.svg"><img alt="../../_images/workflow.svg" class="drawio align-center" src="../../_images/workflow.svg" style="width: 456.53px; height: 533.92px;" />
</a>
<p>The following sections describe each step in detail:</p>
<section id="step-1-polar-alignment">
<h2>Step 1: Polar alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-polar-alignment" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>All credits for explaining the following section go to 10micron and many experts
using the mount.</p>
<section id="initial-alignment">
<h3>Initial alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-alignment" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Initial three star alignment insufficient to get a good polar alignment error
(PAE) value. A two star alignment can only give a poor PAE estimate as the cone
error correction is missing, can be many arc minutes off true value Minimum that
can be used is 3 stars but they recommend at least 5 and ideally 10 points
(ideally based on experiments say that 12 to 20 points have better convergence
without spending too much effort).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>20 points in MountWizzard4 using the fast ASTAP plate solver will do
20 points in around 7 minutes - not too onerous for a good PAE
measurement.</p>
</div>
<p>Pay attention also that the stars are not near to the same maximum circle (i.e.
not all near the same right ascension, or all near the same azimuth, etc.). When
using few stars, how the stars are chosen is critical.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>MountWizzard4 helps here by automating the spread of points to avoid
the problems listed through its various point layout patterns.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/polar_align.png"><img alt="../../_images/polar_align.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/polar_align.png" style="width: 568.0px; height: 426.0px;" />
</a>
<p>The hemisphere window is showing different colors and sizes for selecting the
right stars once the Polar/Ortho mode is selected. You need a valid first model
in the mount to use this feature!</p>
<p>As you add stars, more and more model terms will be added um of either
(# points - 1) or 11 terms for a single all sky model - 11 terms meaning all
required terms have a solution. Note that this may be split into two models for
east side and west side in which case the number of terms shown by the mount is
doubled.</p>
<p>A polar alignment error less than maybe one arcminute will be possible.
If you are using Dual Axis Tracking it sorts all this out for you. (A 10 minute
exposure with a 10 arc minute (1/6 degree) PAE will not show field rotation on a
large full frame sensor up to latitude 60 north or south)</p>
</section>
<section id="how-polar-align-works">
<h3>How polar align works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-polar-align-works" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The polar align function works in a really easy way. It removes the polar axis
error from the model before pointing at the star, so when you center the star
with the azimuth/altitude movements the right ascension axis will be
automatically aligned with the celestial pole.</p>
<p>Choosing location in the sky of the star to use to do the polar alignment
correction is critical. The choice of the star is made so you avoid the zones
where the manual movements have no effect. Avoid the zenith (this is where the
azimuth knob has no effect). Avoid the East-West axis (this is where the
altitude adjustment knob has no effect)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>MountWizzard4 will help you selecting the right location by marking
the right regions and tight stars. In addition you don’t need to use
the handpad for selecting the stars: in MountWizzard4 you could
select the reference star with a mouse click and start the polar
alignment.</p>
</div>
<p>In MountWizzard4 the polar alignment works by changing the mode to polar/ortho
alignment. In this mode, you could select a star in the hemisphere window with
a mouse click and start slew the mount to the reference star. All you need is
to center the selected reference star in you image.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For centering a star you could use the image window, select for
continuous exposure and enable the crosshair. You could also magnify
the region around the crosshair center to improve the precision.</p>
</div>

<section id="should-i-deactivate-the-dual-axis-tracking">
<h3>Should I deactivate the dual axis tracking?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-i-deactivate-the-dual-axis-tracking" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have the dual axis tracking active, the mount will track using the model
built in the initial phase (the initial 3 points generates a minimum model with
2 terms - its not a good model).</p>
<p>You will not be getting the correct tracking rate while you adjust the alt/az
knobs. So if you wait too much before centering the star and giving confirmation
to the mount controller, or if the initial error is very large, there will be a
drift. Therefore you must turn off dual tracking while performing the PA
procedure.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/model_disable_dat.png"><img alt="../../_images/model_disable_dat.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/model_disable_dat.png" style="width: 570.8399999999999px; height: 446.59px;" />

<section id="effects-of-polar-misalignment">
<h3>Effects of polar misalignment<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-of-polar-misalignment" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even if your mount is wildly away from a correct polar alignment, when you make
a model the correction of the polar misalignment will be performed exactly when
Dual Axis Tracking is activated. This means that the pointing error and the
tracking error will be the same - if you make a model with the same number of
stars and the same accuracy - whether the mount is aligned with the celestial
pole or not. When dual axis tracking is deactivated, the mount will track like
a normal equatorial mount, by moving the right ascension axis at a constant
sidereal speed.</p>
<p>The only important thing that will change with increasing PAE is the field
rotation.</p>

<section id="step-2-selecting-build-points">
<h2>Step 2: Selecting build points<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-selecting-build-points" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step for building a model is the selection of the desired model
points. Handling you horizon is an important step as MountWizzard4 helps you
could in finding points, which were not covered through obstacles in your
location defined by the horizon line.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/build_points1.png"><img alt="../../_images/build_points1.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/build_points1.png" style="width: 568.0px; height: 426.0px;" />
</a>
<p>There were multiple ways of setting your model points within MountWizzard4:</p>
<table class="hlist"><tr><td><ul class="simple">
<li><p>From file</p></li>
<li><p>In a generated alt/az grid</p></li>
<li><p>First align points on defined alt</p></li>
<li><p>Points along the celestial slew paths</p></li>
<li><p>Equally distributed over the sphere (golden spiral)</p></li>
<li><p>From the actual model (replicating tha actual one)</p></li>
<li><p>Based on a DSO track of an object with define Ra/Dec</p></li>
<li><p>Manually set point (in hemisphere window)</p></li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There are multiple parameters or selections available to refine your point
selection. the best way to find out is simplest to test them.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Please think that you distribute the model points at the end over a
sphere! Using alt/az is convenient, but might be misleading. You
could enable the polar view in hemisphere window to get an image
how the points are spread in a polar diagram.</p>
</div>
<p>It makes a lot of sense if you have discovered you favourite model points setup
to store them in a file and reload them whenever you want. You could store as
many files as you want.</p>
<section id="sorting-build-points">
<h3>Sorting build points<a class="headerlink" href="#sorting-build-points" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>MountWizzard4 does a default sorting for you. If the default does not fit to
your setup, you could tweak the order and additional constraints like you want.
These settings are stored persistent in your profile.</p>
<table class="hlist"><tr><td><ul class="simple">
<li><p>No sort point -&gt; default</p></li>
<li><p>East / West: points from East coordinate to west coordinate (az)</p></li>
<li><p>High / Low: point from high altitude to low altitude (good for domes)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid meridian flip: modeling start at the actual pier side</p></li>
<li><p>Auto delete points within meridian limits</p></li>
<li><p>Auto delete points below horizon</p></li>
<li><p>Add safety distance: adds selected degrees safety margin to horizon</p></li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Regardless what you select, the 10micron mount computer could
only handle a maximum of 100 points</p>
</div>
<p>If you are using a dome, you could select the option to sort the points to
optimize the slewing of the dome. This will happen the following way:</p>
<p>MountWizzard4 simulates a full model run, calculates the mount positions, calcs
from mount the resulting dome azimuth with all geometry corrections and sorts
afterwards the build points that you get ascending azimuth for the dome.</p>

<section id="step-3-running-the-model-build">
<h2>Step 3: Running the model build<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-running-the-model-build" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After you have selected you build points, MountWizzard4 could automatically run
through the points and generate the data to generate a model. These are steps
you could basically all manual as the final model calculation itself is done in
the mount computer! There are two different ways offered from 10micron to build
a model:</p>
<table class="hlist"><tr><td><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Incremental</p></li>
<li><p>Batch</p></li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>
<p>In incremental model build, each new point will start a recalculation of the
model in the mount. This behavior is also called sync refine, as with each point
the model is processed.</p>
<p>In batch model build, a complete set of point and their data are transferred to
the mount computer, which calculates from this data a new model.</p>
<p>In result both variant will produce the same model with the same quality. The
difference is the way and the context you are working in. MountWizzard4 uses
the batch model build as there are advantages (not in the model quality) in the
automatic handling of point data.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/model_build.png"><img alt="../../_images/model_build.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/model_build.png" style="width: 568.0px; height: 426.0px;" />
</a>
<p>In the “model build and program” tab, that actual model spec from
the mount computer is shown. If you are in an early stage of your setup, you might use
some of the hints given to refine and tune your mechanical setup before building
your final model for imaging.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>All values which are show in these graphs were calculated by the
mount computer itself and just read out and displayed by
MountWizzard4. As the 10micron algorithm of the model optimizer is

</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>

<h3>Explanation model build process:<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-model-build-process" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model correct for error. Some could be removed exactly, some not. The way is
a mathematically optimization method. In max the mount could calculate 22 terms
(which means two models of a set of 11 terms, one for WEST and one for EAST
side). If you need 22 parameters for the model (for whatever reason the mount
thinks), you have to have at minimum 22 alignment stars or more. Otherwise this
will not result in 22 parameters. Again like in polar alignment: think of what
is the goal of this task. For sure you would like to remove as much of the
alignment error to be able to get unguided images.</p>
</section>
<section id="modeling-automatics">
<h3>Modeling automatics<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-automatics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The automation process is explained by the next drawing. It is quite simple, but
there are some important topic, which you should care about.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/model_process.svg" class="drawio align-center" src="../../_images/model_process.svg" />
<p>MountWizzard4 tries to do as much steps at the same time as possible to reach
the minimum model build time. So <strong>“Take an image”</strong> means that the signal to
do the next slew to the point is already started when the camera sends image
integration finished. During image download and image saving, slewing is already
on the way. The same happens to image solve. MountWizzard4 does not wait until
an image is plate solved, but manages as much images in the shortest time. If
your plate solver is fast, your don’t see much of this asynchronous behavior, if
you use a slower one or if you are running MountWizzard4 on a slower machine,
you might experience a stack of plate solving tasks when the mount slewing and
imaging is already finished.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For the plate solver a starting Ra/Dec and scale hint is necessary
for a successful plate solve. Please check your environment if INDI
or INDIGO embeds this data in the FITS header of the image file.</p>
</div>
<p>You could <strong>“Pause”</strong> the model build at any time, but MountWizzard4 will finish
after a sequence which allows safely to pause. It will not happen immediately.</p>
<p>You also could <strong>“End”</strong> the model build process at any time. In this case
MountWizzard4 will take all already existing data and tries to program a model
to the mount.</p>
<p>In addition you could <strong>“Cancel”</strong> a model build run. In this case all data is
lost.</p>
<p>MountWizzard4 offers a disabling of dual tracking during the model build run and
restores this state afterwards or a mount park after a model build is finished.</p>
<p>During a model build it might happen due to clouds or other events, that some
of the images from model point could not be solved an therefore used for model
build. For this situation you could enable a retry mechanism for the
<strong>“missed”</strong> points. After running through all points, MountWizzard4 will retry
the missed ones N times and will add their data if possible afterwards.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-model-datafiles">
<h3>Using model datafiles<a class="headerlink" href="#using-model-datafiles" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>MountWizzard4 stores for each model build run all data (and some more for
analyse) to build a mount model. With this data you could rebuild at any time
you mount model from scratch if you for example deleted to much points during
optimisation or other reasons.</p>
<p>In addition you have the chance to combine multiple model runs to a single mount
model! Please think of the maximum of 100 point the mount computer will handle
to calculate a mount model.</p>
<p>The warning about the invalidation of the model when mechanical changes are made
are true for this step as well. Combining model data from different mechanical
setups lead into an invalid model. Rebuilding a model from old data when
mechanical changes were made result also in an incorrect model.</p>
</section>
<section id="fast-align">
<h3>Fast Align<a class="headerlink" href="#fast-align" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is a way to adjust an existing model to a certain sphere position. If you
choose fast align, MountWizzard4 will do for the actual position an image, plate
solve it an align the model to the solved coordinates. This means the whole
model is move in a way, that the actual pointing coordinates and solved
coordinates are equal. But this changes model pointing for all other position in
the sky as well without knowing if this shift really fits there.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Fast align is a step to adjust quickly a reasonable model to an
actual pointing position. This action is not a model build process!
You most probably loose the pointing accuracy of you model!</p>

window. All functions there are related to the actual mount model or the models
stored in the mount.</p>
<p>Three graphs are available for checking the model:</p>

<p>In all graphs you will see the pink lines which show the value of the Target
(RMS) setting in the “Optimize actual model” box. This helps in adjusting a
cut-off value for automatic model point removal.</p>

<h3>Optimizing the model<a class="headerlink" href="#optimizing-the-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>I some cases you will discover that some model points and their errors are
outside a reasonable area. In that case three different model optimization
scenarios come into place. The first and the obvious one is to remove manually
the worst point of the model (1).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/target_rms_01.png"><img alt="../../_images/target_rms_01.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/target_rms_01.png" style="width: 570.13px; height: 445.16999999999996px;" />
</a>
<p>If you have more than a single point to remove, the second and third come into
place, an automation process within MountWizzard4. With setting the checkbox
“Optimize overall Target RMS” (3) and starting the optimization run (6),
MountWizzard4 will delete as many point until the Model RMS (2) is below the
selected threshold (5).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/target_rms_02.png"><img alt="../../_images/target_rms_02.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/target_rms_02.png" style="width: 570.13px; height: 445.16999999999996px;" />
</a>
<p>Checking “Delete point above Target RMS” (4) and run (6) the optimization,
MountWizzard4 will delete all points where their individual Error is above the
selected threshold (5). Please note that this will lead to a different Model
RMS (2).</p>

<h3>Explanation of optimization of process:<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-optimization-of-process" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes you could remove bad points from the model. But does it help ? Again from
mathematics: you bend an error curve like a metal plate over a rough surface to
equalize it. If the is a single stone under this plate -&gt; approximation might be
bad. So removing this stone might help in getting a better approximation for the
rest of the surface. But it is not good to remove the gravel under the plate to
improve just numbers in RMS! If I see large outliers in alignment errors within
an area which shows good numbers around, I remove that single point. But not to
much. In average I remove 2-5 points from a 60 point model max. Yes if you
remove a point the over RMS could rise ! That’s because the whole model is newly
calculated and that’s no subtraction of a bad point.</p>
